# Hi there, I'm E-pencil 👋

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong background in Rust, backend services, and systems programming. I enjoy diving deep into the inner workings of technologies and building robust and scalable solutions. Here's a bit about me and what I'm currently working on.

## 🌟 About Me

- 🦀 Experienced with Rust, having worked at major companies like Kraken and another Bitcoin-only exchange.
- 🏗️ Contributed to improving architectures and implementing caching layers at Kraken.
- 🌐 Improved and made resilient backend at another Bitcoin-only exchange, making it custodian agnostic while enhancing core product features.
- 💡 Fan of 37Signals' work and philosophy, and have been following them and DHH since the mid-2000s.

## 🚀 Projects

### Ledger Database
An open-source mini database written in Rust, designed to model financial transactions with ease. It includes a storage layer, an API interface, and a query language with its compiler and virtual machine. The transactions are append-only.
A Redis clone implemented in Rust. Heads up, the code is old, but my Rust skills have improved significantly since then.
